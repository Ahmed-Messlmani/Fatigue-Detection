# Fatigue-Detection

Our proposed solution consists in developing a web application using Flask and supervised machine learning algorithms. Our application ensures the classification of photos into two classes: fatigue and non-fatigue. It also provides a sophisticated interface to allow the user to choose the image capture mode. There are 3 modes, the first one is the capture from your camera, the second one is taking a picture with the webcam and the third one consists in launching a video streaming and detecting each frame of this video fatigue or not.
